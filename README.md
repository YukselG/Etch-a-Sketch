# Etch-a-Sketch 🎨

This is a simple Etch A Sketch project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to draw on a customizable grid by hovering over cells. The grid size can be adjusted dynamically, and the drawing effect mimics an Etch A Sketch board.

## Features 🚀

-   Dynamic grid creation - The grid is generated using JavaScript, allowing flexible resizing.
-   Hover effect - Squares change color when the mouse passes over them.
-   User-defined grid size - Users can enter a size (3-100) and generate a new grid.

## How to Use 🖌️

1. Open index.html in a web browser.
2. Hover over the grid to "draw" by changing the square colors.
3. Enter a number (3-100) in the input field and click "Generate!" to create a new grid.

## Files

-   HTML – Structure of the webpage.
-   CSS (Flexbox) – Styling and layout of the grid.
-   JavaScript – Grid generation, event handling, and interactivity.

## Possible Improvements 🔧

🔹 Implement a color picker for custom drawing colors.
🔹 Include a "Rainbow Mode" for randomized colors.
🔹 Add an "Eraser" mode to reset individual squares.
